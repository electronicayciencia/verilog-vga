Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to twenty-one:

And Saint Attila raised the hand Grenade up on high saying:

"O Lord, bless this Thy hand Grenade
That with it Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to Tiny bit's
In Thy mercy"

And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the
lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and orangutans 
and breakfast, cereals and fruit bats and large chu-

And the Lord spake, saying:

"First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin
Then shalt thou count to three
No more no less
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count
And the number of the counting shall be three
Four shalt thou not count
Nor either count thou two
Excepting that thou then proceed to Three
Five is right out

Once the number three, being the third number, be reached
Then lobbest thou Thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards
Thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it"

Amen
